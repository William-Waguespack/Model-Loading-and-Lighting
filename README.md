# Model Loading and Lighting

A C++ OpenGL project demonstrating **3D model loading** and **dynamic lighting**.


## Features
- Load 3D models using Assimp
- Apply vertex and fragment shaders
- Multiple light sources
- Camera movement and interaction


## Prerequisites
- C++17 or higher
- OpenGL 3.3+
- GLFW
- GLAD
- GLM
- Assimp


## Build Instructions (Windows example)
1. Open your IDE (Visual Studio, etc.)
2. Add all `.cpp` and `.h` files from `src/`
3. Link to GLFW, GLAD, GLM, Assimp libraries
4. Set working directory to the root of the repo (so shaders and assets are found)
5. Compile and run
